> [The article](https://azeemba.com/posts/understanding-3d-graphics.html#uv-mapping-and-textures) on Azeemba discusses UV mapping and textures in 3D graphics. UV mapping involves taking a 2D texture and wrapping it around a 3D object by mapping each face of the object to the corresponding area in the texture. This mapping helps shaders determine which part of the texture to use for each vertex. It also explains normal maps, which add surface detail without extra geometry by encoding surface directions in the texture.
